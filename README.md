# MILCH: [M]y functional language [I]nspired by [L]isp, [C]lojure, and [H]askell

## Summary

`MILCH` (or `Milch`, or `milch`) is a interpreted, dynamically typed functional programming language that has some Lisp-inspired syntax and Haskell-inspired semantics. Milch is german for ðŸ¥›.

I'm developing this language by myself as a hobby, and the spec is going to change all the time. Some features documented here might not yet be implemented.

## Usage
